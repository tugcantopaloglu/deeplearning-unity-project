# Deep Learning Unity Project

This repository contains a project that integrates deep learning models with Unity to demonstrate the power of AI in interactive applications and games. The project explores the seamless combination of AI-driven decision-making and Unity's game development environment.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Integration**: Real-time decision-making using trained AI models.
- **Unity Framework**: Combines Unity's interactive capabilities with AI.
- **Customizable Models**: Swap out models to experiment with different AI behaviors.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on multiple platforms supported by Unity.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C#, Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model development)
  - ML-Agents (Unity's Machine Learning Toolkit)
- **Game Engine**: Unity

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor:
   - [Download Unity](https://unity.com/download)

2. Install Python and necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r PythonScripts/requirements.txt
   ```

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tugcantopaloglu/deeplearning-unity-project.git
   ```

2. Open the Unity project:
   - Launch Unity Hub and click **Open Project**.
   - Select the cloned repository.

3. Configure the deep learning model:
   - Place your trained models in the `Models/` directory.

4. Run the project:
   - Open a scene from the `Scenes/` folder and press **Play** in Unity.

## Usage

1. Train a deep learning model:
   - Use the Python scripts in `PythonScripts/` to train your AI model.

2. Export the model:
   - Convert the trained model into a format compatible with Unity.

3. Integrate the model in Unity:
   - Use Unity's ML-Agents toolkit or custom scripts to load and interact with the model.

## Example

### Training a Model

```bash
python PythonScripts/train_model.py --epochs 100
```

### Using the Model in Unity

- Import the exported model into Unity and attach it to the appropriate game object via script.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using TensorFlow;

public class AIController : MonoBehaviour {
    private TFModel model;

    void Start() {
        model = LoadModel("path/to/model");
    }

    void Update() {
        var input = GetInputData();
        var output = model.Predict(input);
        ApplyOutput(output);
    }
}
```
